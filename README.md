# Road-Sign-Detection

This deep learning model is created for my capstone project. During the course of creation of this model, I have learnt about:
- the various CNN model architectures
- the various layers used for creation of the model
- different concepts of deep learning for image recognition

The first model applied is a custom CNN architecture,
- the model learning performed 15 times with a batch size of 32

The second model applied is the VGGNet architecture
- the model learning performed only 5 times due to time constraints

Both models have given an accuracy of more that **90%**.

The project is still in progress, 
- we will be applying the DenseNet model
- create an app and prototype 
- have the epochs set to to 15 for all models
- also try reading the data using yolov5 model
